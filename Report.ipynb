    "Owning a fast food franchise is one of the best choice for living with a promising income. Not only does the owner not need to pivot around advertising and marketing, but also to forgo the need of product development and quality control. However, it can be a costly venture. Let's say McDonalds. In Indonesia, you must have at least Rp 14,500,000,000 in total to start developing your franchise venue (equivalent to one million USD). Because the cost are unimaginably high, we need to consider a strategic placement for our franchise in order to get the best possible outcome that leads to the optimum amount of profit."

We build the agglomerative clustering model to see how each sub-districts segmented from each other. These analysis is fairly useful to be used in the future for making decision on venue placement or for further research. However, this analysis opens so many door for improvements in the future. For example, this analysis only segments the sub-districts based on the similarity because the socio-demographic data for urban village, hamlet, or even neighborhood are harder to gather. Perhaps we could make smaller division for clustering and put more effort in gathering more data. We could also replace the satisfaction data to a data that more reliable such as cencus data and behavioral data related to population needs of culinary.\n"
